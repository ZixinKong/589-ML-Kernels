# 589-ML-Kernels
Train and evaluate different kernels for both classification and regression on three datasets based on Python 3.6 via Anaconda.

Experimenting with kernel methods for regression and classification problems using kernel ridge regression and support vector machine (SVM).

- Kernel Ridge Regression

- SVM: This is a classification method that can assign classes to new samples using only the inner product between the new samples and the samples in the training data. This allows us to use several different kernels, which makes SVM an extremely powerful classification method.
